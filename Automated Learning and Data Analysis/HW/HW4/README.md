These instructions should help you run our neural network! Our model was built on tensorflow 2.10.0 in python 3.9 with the tensorflow backend. All random elements
were initialized with the seed 2022 prior to running any code. 

To run this code successfully, ensure that you have a directory titled 'ANN' in the same directory as the HW4Q4.py file. This folder should include all relevant
data for the model to evaluate. The files are: 'test_data_2022.csv', 'train_data_2022.csv', and 'val_data_2022.csv', all downloaded in the ANN .zip folder posted on
the moodle site. For your convenience, the ANN directory with relevant data has been uploaded to our repository as well. 

With all data in place, the code should run without issue. It will iterate over the model for each number of hidden neurons, produce a plot with the training and 
validation accuracy vs. the number of hidden neurons, then report loss and accuracy metrics for each of the iterations over the set of hidden neuron numbers! All
of the code output should be visible in the "Run' window in PyCharm or in the equivalent window in other IDEs.
