"""CLI to WolfMedia.

Perform a variety of operations against the WolfMedia System,
including:

1. Information Processing: Enter/update/delete basic information about
songs, artists, podcast hosts, and podcast episodes. Assign songs and
artists to albums. Assign artists to record labels. Assign podcast
episodes and podcast hosts to podcasts.

2. Maintaining metadata and records: Enter/update play count for
songs.  Enter/update the count of monthly listeners for
artists. Enter/update the total count of subscribers and ratings for
podcasts. Enter/Update the listening count for podcast episodes. Find
songs and podcast episodes given artist, album, and/or podcast.

3.  Maintaining payments: Make royalty payments for a given
song. Monthly royalties are generated based on a royalty rate for each
song times the total play count per month. 30% of the collected
royalties are paid to the record label and the remainder is
distributed evenly among all participating artists. Make payment to
podcast hosts. Podcast hosts are paid a single flat fee per released
episode and an additional bonus based on total advertisements per
podcast episode. Receive payment from subscribers.

4. Reports: Generate all the following reports: Monthly play count per
song/album/artist. Calculate total payments made out to
host/artist/record labels per a given time period. Total revenue of
the streaming service per month, per year. Report all songs/podcast
episodes given an artist, album, and/or podcast.
