# Corey Capooci's Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. The majority, if not all, of this repo holds the work that I have created throughout my time at North Carolina State University when I was pursuing my [Master of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/graduate/degrees/mcs.php) (MCS). 

This work will include my writings, code, scripts, or other work that is not already stored in another repository. Much of this work was completed as a part of group assignments, and I will do my best to document in the contributions that I made to each. 

In addition to everything in this repo, I am also especially proud of the [thesis](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/5300cvc5673) that I completed as an undergraduate at Penn State. Please take a look at that, if it interests you.    

Enjoy! Reach out if you have any questions.
