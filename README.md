# Corey Capooci's Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. The majority of this repo holds the work that I have contributed to at North Carolina State University when I was pursuing my [Master of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/graduate/degrees/mcs.php) (MCS).  In addition, I have my personal projects, as submodules, in the Projects folder. 

This work includes writings, research, code, video demostrations, etc. Much of this work was completed as a part of group assignments, especially my school work.  This shows the success that I had working in many differents groups on a broad range of projects.  

In addition to everything in this repo, I am also especially proud of the [thesis](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/5300cvc5673) that I completed as an undergraduate at Penn State. Please take a look at that, if it interests you.    

Enjoy! Reach out if you have any questions.

## Future Updates

I am in the process of completing my degree and I am completing 3 more classes, Managerial Finance, Software Security, and Metaheuristics. 
Once I complete these courses, I plan on adding my work from them as well!
