| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 | Problem Statement is clear |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 | Description of the solution sounds good. |
| **Use Cases** | 12.5/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:     UC1 is too high-level "Celebrimbot asks for details about the new bot and its purpose"  What details will it ask for?  Those are the kind of decisions you need to make and include in your use cases.  [E1] "User Provided invalid information. No repo is created."  no error message?  Helpful hint or clue as to what broke it?<br><br>UC2 is probably too difficult, and UC3 is not necessary.     Break UC1 into more pieces, rather than a monolithic one.  For example, you could have UC where the user asks how to use Celebrimbot. <br><br>What kinds of bots can it make?   It would be valuable enough if it just made scaffolds.    |
| **Wireframes** | 15.0/15 | Good use of wireframe. |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Storyboard tell a story. |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 25.0/30 | The architecture diagram is a little unclear. Mattermost responder and Core part could have been elaborated in the diagram to show all the components within the diagram, instead of just the textual explanation. |
